# Exercise 2: Deploying the model using Flask framework locally and on Azure App Service

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy the model using the Flask framework locally and also from the Azure app service.

## Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Deploy the model by running the Flask wrapper locally
- Task 2: Test the locally-deployed API with specified request/response formats
- Task 3: Deploy the model on Azure App Service
- Task 4: Test the cloud-deployed API with specified request/response formats

## Task 1: Deploy the model by running the Flask wrapper locally
    
1. Navigate to **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** and click on **Open Terminal**.

1. Navigate to the required path by running the below-given command on the Terminal page:

    ```
    cd artifacts/openai-model
    ```
1. Run the below-mentioned command to run the Flask wrapper and copy the generated local host URL:

   ```
   flask run
   ```

   > **Note**: Don't hit **Ctrl + c**.
   
## Task 2: Test the locally-deployed API with specified request/response formats

1. Navigate to the **notebooks** folder, select **flask-app-local-test.ipynb (1)** file and select the kernal as **Python 3.8-AzureML (2)**.
