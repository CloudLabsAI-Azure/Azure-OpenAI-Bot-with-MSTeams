# Exercise 1: Leveraging an OpenAI model to create extract data and create embeddings

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will be installing the required packages from the Machine learning studio. You will also be deploying the Model in Open AI by running the Python notebook from the Machine learning studio.

## Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Install all the required libraries using the requirements.txt file
- Task 2: Update the configuration file with newly generated credentials
- Task 3: Experiment with notebooks to explore data and model

## Task 1: Install all the required libraries using the requirements.txt file

In this task, you are going to install all the necessary libraries by running the requirements.txt file in the Machine Learning Studio, setting up the environment for model deployment.

1. In Azure Portal, on the **Search resources, services, and docs** search for **Resource groups (1)**, and click on **Resource groups (2)**.

1. On Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio Click on **Notebooks (1)** and click on **Open Terminal (2)** and run the below-mentioned commands

    ```
    cd artifacts/openai-model
    ```

    ```
    pip install enum34
    pip install cmdstanpy==0.9.5
    ```
   
    ```
    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    ```
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
    
    ```
    pip install numpy==1.23.5
    ```

    > **Note**: If you encounter **ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed**, please ignore it and continue.

1. Now you need to restart the compute instance after installing the required packages. Follow the below steps to restart the compute instance:

   -  Select **Compute (1)** under Manage
   -  Choose the pre-deployed compute instance **mlmodelcompute<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**
   -  Click on **Restart (3)**

      >**Note:** Wait for the restart to be completed.
   
## Task 2: Update the configuration file with newly generated credentials

In this task, you will update the configuration file with the newly generated API credentials, allowing your environment to securely connect to the OpenAI model.

1. Navigate back to the Azure Portal and from the **Overview (1)** page of the resource group select Azure Open AI **OpenAI<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**.

1. On the Select a model pop-up, Select **text-embedding-ada-002 (1)** and click on **Confirm(2)**.

   ![](Images/model01.png)
   
1.  On the Deploy model text-embedding-ada-002 pop-up enter the deployment name as **ada002(1)** and scale down the **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands) (2)** to **5k** then click on **Deploy (3)**.

    ![](Images/model02.png)

1. Now again Click on **+ Deploy model** from Deployments and select **Deploy base model**.

   ![](Images/newdeployment01.png)

1. On the Select a model pop-up, Select **gpt-35-turbo-instruct (1)** and click on **Confirm(2)**.

    ![](Images/model05.png)
   
3. On the Deploy model gpt-35-turbo-instruct pop-up , enter the deployment name as **davinci003 (1)**,from Model Version drop-down select **0914(2)** and scale down the **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands) (3)** to **5k** then click on **Deploy (4)**.

   ![](Images/model06.png)

1. Now navigate back to the Azure portal, click on **Keys and Endpoints (1)**, select **Show Keys (2)**, and copy the values of **Key 1 (3)** and **Endpoint (4)** in a notepad. You will be using these values in the next steps.
