# Empower Knowledge Workers using Azure OpenAI with MS Teams and Azure Bot Service

### Overall Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore how to empower knowledge workers by integrating Azure OpenAI with a Microsoft Teams Bot for IT Service Management (ITSM). You will begin by leveraging an OpenAI model to extract data and create embeddings by installing necessary packages and running a Python notebook in Azure Machine Learning Studio. Through hands-on tasks, you will deploy the OpenAI model, configure credentials, and experiment with notebooks, gaining practical experience in data exploration and embedding creation.

## Objective

Learn to leverage an OpenAI model to extract data and create embeddings, by end of this lab you will be able to:

- **Leveraging an OpenAI model to create extract data and create embeddings:** Use an OpenAI model to extract data and create embeddings for advanced data processing and retrieval. Participants will learn to extract data and create embeddings using an OpenAI model for advanced data analysis.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **Knowledge of Azure Machine Learning Studio**: Familiarity with deploying and working in Azure ML Studio.
- **Basic Python Programming Skills**: Ability to run Python notebooks and update configuration files.
- **Experience with OpenAI Models**: Understanding of OpenAI's capabilities, such as generating embeddings and processing data.
  
## Architecture

The architecture integrates Azure OpenAI Service with Azure Machine Learning Studio to create embeddings for ITSM applications. Data is processed through Python notebooks in Azure ML Studio, which deploys the OpenAI model for embedding creation. The embeddings are then used to enhance ITSM workflows in applications like Microsoft Teams Bot, ensuring efficient knowledge retrieval and interaction.
